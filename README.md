# Google-ML-Linear-Regression-1

This project is an implementation of the Linear Regression section in Google's ML Concepts Crash Course.

Most of the code is generally just copy and pasted since I don't know what I'm doing yet, but I got it to work on my local machine so that's a win!

Make sure you choose Python 3.12 instead of 3.13 because TensorFlow doesn't have a 3.13 install yet.
